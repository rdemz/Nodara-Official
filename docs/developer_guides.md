# Developer Guides for Nodara BIOSPHÈRE QUANTIC - Legendary Edition

This guide provides step-by-step instructions and best practices for developers to integrate with, extend, and contribute to Nodara BIOSPHÈRE QUANTIC. It covers environment setup, code standards, module integration, and advanced customization.

## 1. Environment Setup

- **Prerequisites:**
  - Install the latest stable Rust toolchain (with Clippy and Rustfmt).
  - Ensure Docker is installed for containerized deployments.
  - Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nodara.git
    cd nodara
    ```
- **Local Development:**
  - Build the project in release mode:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
  - Run unit and integration tests:
    ```bash
    cargo test --all --verbose
    ```

## 2. Code Standards and Best Practices

- **Modularity:**  
  Maintain separation of concerns by following the established module (pallet) structure.
- **Documentation:**

  Follow the established architectural patterns for creating new pallets. Ensure that each new module includes:
  - A detailed README.md
  - Complete test coverage (unit, integration, benchmarks)
  - DAO governance hooks for dynamic updates
- **Integrating with Offchain Workers:**  
  Use the provided offchain worker examples to implement parallel processing for heavy computations.
- **Interfacing via SDK:**  
  Utilize the Nodara SDK for building external integrations, ensuring seamless interaction with on-chain operations.

## 4. Contribution Guidelines

- **Code Reviews:**  
  All contributions are subject to rigorous internal code reviews, with an emphasis on performance, security, and maintainability.
- **Continuous Integration:**  
  Ensure that all changes pass the CI/CD pipeline without regressions.
